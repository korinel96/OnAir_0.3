Hello Everyone!

This project is based on libstreaming. The main idea is to make rtsp server out of android smartphone to stream video/audio content from it.

If you have any questions, please contact me: vkjohn96@gmail.com (korinel).

P.S. It seems that libstreaming stopped working properly on andorid 4.4+ (MediaRecorder API fails to do anything).
